    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 10 November 2025</p>

    <h2>1. What we do</h2>
    <p>TeeRadar is an information and convenience service that helps golfers discover public golf courses and navigate to the course’s own booking system. We do <strong>not</strong> own or operate the golf courses, and we do <strong>not</strong> collect payment on behalf of the golf courses.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-party booking pages</h2>
    <p>When you click “Proceed to booking” you may be redirected to a third-party or course-managed booking page (for example MiClub, Quick18, or the course’s own website). Availability, prices, player limits and rules on those pages are controlled by the course. If TeeRadar shows availability that differs from the course’s own site, the course’s site is the source of truth.</p>

    <h2>3. Accuracy of information</h2>
    <p>We try to show up-to-date course links and availability patterns, but these can change without notice. TeeRadar does not guarantee that a specific tee time will still be available when you reach the course booking page.</p>

    <h2>4. Your account</h2>
    <p>You may need to create an account to access some features. You are responsible for keeping your login details secure. Admin accounts may grant additional access such as managing users and “no ads” lists.</p>

    <h2>5. Ads & sponsorship</h2>
    <p>TeeRadar may display advertising, including pop-up ads, except for selected users added by the site owner. Ads may link to third-party services. We are not responsible for the content or services provided by those third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. No guarantee / limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TeeRadar is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties, representations or conditions, and we are not liable for any loss, booking failure, overbooking, price changes or course closures arising from the use of this site.</p>

    <h2>7. Fair use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to misuse the site, attempt to scrape excessive data, or interfere with the availability checks.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continuing to use the site after an update means you accept the new terms.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:24px;">If you have questions, contact the site owner.</p>
