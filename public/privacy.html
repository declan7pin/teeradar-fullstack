    <h1>Privacy & Policies</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Last updated: 24 November 2025<br />
      This page explains how TeeRadar WA collects and uses information and how advertising (including Google AdSense) works on our site.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>TeeRadar WA</strong> is a golf tee-time search tool based in Western Australia.
      We show public golf courses and then send you to each course’s own booking site. We do not take
      payments or bookings on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What TeeRadar does</h2>
    <p>
      TeeRadar WA lets you search WA public courses by date, time window, holes and players.
      When you click a result, you are taken to the course’s official booking page (for example
      MiClub, Quick18 or a club website). Any booking you make is between you and the course.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect a small amount of information when you use TeeRadar WA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account details:</strong> If you create a TeeRadar login, we store your email address, password (encrypted) and optional “home course”.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact messages:</strong> If you use our contact form, we receive the email address and details you submit so we can reply.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> We log basic analytics such as pages viewed, buttons clicked (e.g. “Find a tee time”), and anonymised course interest. This helps us improve the product.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> Your browser type, approximate region, device type and similar technical information sent by your browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
    <p>
      TeeRadar WA and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remember your login session.</li>
      <li>Remember preferences such as your last search date or home course.</li>
      <li>Measure traffic and usage patterns.</li>
      <li>Show and measure advertising on the site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can control cookies through your browser settings. If you disable cookies, some features (for example
      staying logged in) may not work as expected.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Advertising and Google AdSense</h2>
    <p>
      We use <strong>Google AdSense</strong> to show ads on TeeRadar WA. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to this and/or other websites.</li>
      <li>Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visits to TeeRadar WA and other sites on the internet.</li>
      <li>You may opt out of personalised advertising from Google by visiting your <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a> page. You can also learn more at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s advertising privacy page</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not have access to raw data from Google’s cookies; we only see aggregated reports (for example how many ad impressions were shown).
    </p>

    <h2>6. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain TeeRadar WA.</li>
      <li>Operate your account and remember your preferences.</li>
      <li>Respond to support or contact requests.</li>
      <li>Monitor usage, detect abuse and keep the service secure.</li>
      <li>Improve features, layouts and course coverage.</li>
      <li>Show, measure and improve advertising (for example, which pages perform best).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. When we share information</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We may share limited information with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> who host our site, store our database or process analytics/ads (for example, Render, Google, email providers).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal or safety purposes</strong> if we are required to by law, or if we need to protect the rights, property or safety of TeeRadar WA, our users or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Links to course and third-party sites</h2>
    <p>
      When you click a booking link, you leave TeeRadar WA and go to a course’s own site or booking platform.
      Their privacy policies and terms apply there, not ours. We don’t control those systems and don’t see your payment details.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data storage and security</h2>
    <p>
      We store data using reputable hosting and database providers. We take reasonable steps to protect
      your information (for example, encrypting passwords and restricting access), but no website can be
      100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>10. How long we keep information</h2>
    <p>
      We keep account and analytics data only for as long as we need it for the purposes described above,
      or as required by law. We may anonymise or aggregate data so it can no longer be linked to you.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your choices and rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal information we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Ask us to correct inaccurate information.</li>
      <li>Ask us to delete your account and associated personal information, where legally allowed.</li>
      <li>Object to certain uses of your data, such as direct marketing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before acting on your request.
    </p>
